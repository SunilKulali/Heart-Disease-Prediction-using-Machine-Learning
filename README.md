# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The goal is to analyze, preprocess, and train classification models to provide accurate predictions.

# üìå Project Overview
* **Dataset:** Contains patient health records and heart disease indicators.<br>
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.<br>
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying correlations and key risk factors using visualizations.<br>
# Machine Learning Models:
* Logistic Regression<br>
* Decision Tree<br>
* Random Forest<br>
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)<br>

* **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy scores, confusion matrix, classification reports.<br>
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using GridSearchCV to improve performance.<br>
* **Visualization:** Model comparison, feature importance, and performance metrics.<br>
